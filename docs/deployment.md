# Deployment

## Scope

Turnstile infrastructure includes PostgreSQL, Event Hubs, Storage, Key Vault, Application Insights, the Web App, telemetry and control-plane Functions, and APIM configuration. FastAPI and the observer each have a dedicated App Service Plan. The telemetry and control-plane Functions each have a separate Flex Consumption plan, deployment container, and VNet subnet. The templates do not create Azure AI Foundry projects or provider model deployments.

The API, telemetry and control-plane Functions, observer, and budget ledger require public service endpoints for package deployment or runtime traffic. They explicitly enable public network access and carry the resource-level `SecurityControl=Ignore` tag so an organization-level network Modify policy does not silently disable them. The exemption is not applied at resource-group scope; platform Storage and Key Vault resources designed for private-link access remain private.

## Choose the v1.1 deployment path

| Your installation | Use | Keep or create |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turnstile v1.0 is already installed | [Upgrade an existing installation](#upgrade-v10-to-v11) | Keep the original parameter file, secret state, outputs, database, ledger, APIM, identities and history. |
| No Turnstile installation exists | [Deploy from zero](#deploy-v11-from-zero) | Create a new prefix, resource group, state and platform. APIM reuse is an explicit alternative, not the default. |

An application ZIP update alone does not install missing APIM operations or grant the API
permission to update the ledger. Conversely, applying infrastructure alone does not update
the API or Control-plane code. Complete both parts of the selected path.

### Upgrade v1.0 to v1.1

1. Record the deployed version, package hashes, running/stopped application states, migration
  checksums, current APIM revision, model assignments and budget/usage totals. Retain the
  original public parameters, private deployment state and matching outputs. Back up the
  database through the installation's normal backup procedure. Do not regenerate encryption
  keys, bootstrap another Owner, or point at another installation's outputs.
2. Check out the reviewed v1.1 candidate and install its locked dependencies. Schedule a
  maintenance window, drain publications, release operations and old telemetry consumers,
  and exclude concurrent configuration changes. Follow the [APIM upgrade](#incremental-apim-infrastructure-upgrade)
  plan/apply sequence if the fixed image operation or parent contract is missing. That
  versioned upgrade preserves existing text routes and subscriptions; it is not APIM bootstrap.
3. Apply [immediate model-access configuration](#immediate-model-access-upgrade) to every API
  that saves People permissions. Reuse the exact ledger already read by APIM and written by
  Telemetry. Do not create an empty replacement table: it would lose the current enforcement
  state. The template changes only three API settings and Table-scoped identity access.
4. Apply only pending numbered migrations and deploy the v1.1 API, Telemetry and Control-plane
  packages using the existing deployment mechanism. The public `scripts.deploy plan` and
  `deploy` commands accept the **original** `--parameters`, `--state`, and Owner input; their
  saved outputs suppress APIM bootstrap. Review their complete what-if before using them:
  they reconcile the platform, not just application code. For a package-only rollout, retain
  the installation's existing package deployment process and apply the two explicit
  infrastructure upgrades separately. Never replay the full platform solely to fix permissions.
5. Restore the recorded application states and complete the [verification checklist](#verify).
  Confirm prior migration checksums, subscriptions, model routes, budgets and historical usage
  remain intact. Test an existing client as well as the newly installed features.

Keep images disabled and the evidence-v2 cutoff unchanged during the ordinary upgrade.
Enabling images or setting the one-time future cutoff requires the separate
[image/evidence procedure](#image-and-evidence-upgrade-boundary). Do not move an existing cutoff.
Databricks OAuth also remains disabled by default. Installing v1.1 does not grant the APIM
identity access to a Databricks Workspace or any provider account.

Application readiness is an API/Control-plane package change. A new Application must not be
reported ready until its APIM subscription is usable on the data plane; an ARM `active` state
alone is insufficient. Do not rotate existing Application keys as an upgrade workaround.

### Deploy v1.1 from zero

Follow [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), [Prepare public parameters](#prepare-public-parameters),
[Preview](#preview) and [Deploy](#deploy) below with new state and a unique resource prefix.
Do not reuse the v1.0 secret state or database for a clean installation. Verify regional
availability and capacity for PostgreSQL 16, separate Flex Consumption Functions and the
default StandardV2 APIM before provisioning. APIM creation can take substantially longer than
deploying the application packages.

The main template creates the ledger account/table and supplies `LEDGER_SYNC_ENABLED=true`,
`LEDGER_TABLE_ENDPOINT` and `LEDGER_TABLE_NAME` to the API. It grants that API's managed
identity Storage Table Data Contributor on the **new Table**, with dependencies on the new
identity and table. No separate model-access upgrade template is required for this path.

The initial database has no customer models, connections or usage. Sign in as the initial
Owner, create a provider Connection, publish an existing upstream deployment, assign model
access and then test invocation. An unconfigured policy and an explicit empty policy are
different; empty means deny all. Configure real production budgets before admitting client
traffic. A healthy homepage is not proof that publication, identity, permissions or billing work.

For Databricks, use the HTTPS Workspace root, an existing supported serving endpoint and
the managed identity of the **selected APIM**, not the Turnstile API identity. A Workspace
administrator must register/authorize that identity and grant the required serving-endpoint
access. Managed identity is the default; OAuth M2M requires its explicit deployment capability
and scoped APIM Credential Manager permissions. Neither method creates upstream endpoints.
The supported Databricks publication path is native Anthropic chat/streaming, not image
generation or an assumption of every OpenAI-compatible operation.

Foundry text, governed images and an OpenAI-compatible provider have separate model and
credential prerequisites. Images require `IMAGE_GENERATION_ENABLED=true` on both API and
Control-plane and explicit consent for paid probes. Publication probes also consume upstream
requests; include them when choosing a validation budget. Never enable an upstream provider's
local-key authentication or weaken networking merely to complete installation.

### User settings database upgrade

The user-settings API requires `migrations/010_user_settings_profile.up.sql`. It adds
`app_user_avatar` for private normalized avatars and `account_security_event` for account
change auditing and password-verification throttling. It does not rewrite existing accounts,
sessions, budgets or usage, and needs no infrastructure changes or new Graph permissions.
The migration number is independent of the assistant-protocol upgrade; it does not depend
on `009_assistant_api_format`.

1. Back up the existing database and record its `schema_migration` versions and checksums.
   Use the installation's existing secret configuration and authorized migration environment;
   do not put `DATABASE_URL` or credentials into Git or the command line.
2. Before deploying the new API, apply pending migrations through the existing runner:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m backend.migrate
   ```

   The runner applies each pending file transactionally and verifies existing checksums.
   Rerunning it skips applied files; do not run the SQL directly or edit an applied file.
3. Confirm `010_user_settings_profile` appears once in `schema_migration`, both new tables
   exist, and earlier checksums and account/budget/usage data are unchanged. Deploy the
   matching API and frontend packages through the existing deployment process.
4. Verify password-account display-name and avatar updates, wrong-password rejection,
   password replacement followed by reauthentication, and read-only Microsoft profiles.
   A successful password change revokes all existing Turnstile sessions for that account.

For an application rollback, restore the previous API/frontend packages and retain the
additive tables and migration ledger entry. Do not drop audit or avatar data or rewrite
migration history. Rolling back packages does not restore changed passwords or revoked
sessions; database restoration requires a separately reviewed recovery procedure.

### Immediate model-access upgrade

The API also needs network reachability to the ledger. With the default private ledger,
use [model-access-network-upgrade.bicep](../infra/model-access-network-upgrade.bicep) to add
an unused `snet-api` subnet delegated to `Microsoft.Web/serverFarms` and integrate the API
with the platform VNet. Review address-space overlap, private DNS links and the ledger private
endpoint first. The default subnet is `10.42.3.64/27`. This does not open the Storage firewall.

Regional VNet integration requires B1 or higher; F1 is not sufficient. The optional
`restoreFreePlanName` parameter restores one explicitly selected existing Free plan to B1
and incurs Basic-plan charges. Leave it empty to preserve a suitable existing plan. Verify
all apps hosted by that plan and review its what-if before opting in. Apply the network
template with the same explicit subscription and API resource group, before the settings
upgrade below. New installations already include this API subnet and VNet integration.

Use [model-access-upgrade.bicep](../infra/model-access-upgrade.bicep) only for existing API
Web Apps with system-assigned managed identities and an existing ledger. It supports multiple
API names in one resource group and a ledger in another resource group in the same subscription.
Repeat for any other API resource group. Verify the endpoint/table against **both** APIM's
current policy and Telemetry's settings before applying; a successful grant on the wrong table
does not synchronize permissions.

Create a private parameter file at `.turnstile/model-access-upgrade.parameters.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
   "apiNames": { "value": ["<existing-api-name>"] },
   "ledgerResourceGroupName": { "value": "<existing-ledger-resource-group>" },
   "ledgerStorageAccountName": { "value": "<existing-ledger-account>" },
   "ledgerTableName": { "value": "<existing-ledger-table>" }
  }
}
```

Use an identity allowed to update the selected API settings and create role assignments on
the exact Table. If the groups differ, it also needs deployment permission in the ledger group.
Review the resource IDs and reject Delete, storage creation or any unexpected write:

```bash
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID='<subscription-id>'
export API_RESOURCE_GROUP='<existing-api-resource-group>'
uv run python - <<'PY'
import json
import os
import subprocess
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

subscription = os.environ["SUBSCRIPTION_ID"]
group = os.environ["API_RESOURCE_GROUP"]
document = json.loads(Path(".turnstile/model-access-upgrade.parameters.json").read_text())

def read_settings(api_name):
  resource = f"/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{api_name}"
  result = subprocess.run([
    "az", "rest", "--subscription", subscription, "--method", "post",
    "--url", f"https://management.azure.com{resource}/config/appsettings/list?api-version=2024-11-01",
    "--headers", "Accept=application/json", "--output", "json",
  ], check=True, capture_output=True)
  return json.loads(result.stdout)["properties"]

snapshots = {name: read_settings(name) for name in document["parameters"]["apiNames"]["value"]}
document["parameters"]["currentApiSettings"] = {"value": snapshots}
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(prefix="model-access-", dir=".turnstile") as directory:
  parameter_file = Path(directory) / "parameters.json"
  with os.fdopen(os.open(parameter_file, os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL, 0o600), "w") as stream:
    json.dump(document, stream)
  arguments = [
    "--subscription", subscription, "--resource-group", group,
    "--name", "model-access-v1-1", "--template-file", "infra/model-access-upgrade.bicep",
    "--parameters", "@" + str(parameter_file), "--mode", "Incremental",
  ]
  subprocess.run(["az", "deployment", "group", "what-if", *arguments,
          "--result-format", "ResourceIdOnly"], check=True)
  with open("/dev/tty", encoding="utf-8") as terminal:
    print("After reviewing exact API/Table changes, type upgrade: ", end="", flush=True)
    confirmation = terminal.readline().strip()
  if confirmation != "upgrade":
    raise SystemExit("Cancelled without deployment")
  if any(read_settings(name) != settings for name, settings in snapshots.items()):
    raise SystemExit("App Settings changed after preview; repeat from a fresh snapshot")
  subprocess.run(["az", "deployment", "group", "create", *arguments,
          "--output", "none"], check=True)
PY
```

The caller reads current App Settings immediately before preview and supplies them through
the `currentApiSettings` secure object, keyed by API name. The temporary parameter file has
mode `0600`, is removed on exit, and must not be copied into Git or validation evidence.
Run this example in an interactive macOS/Linux terminal; confirmation is read from `/dev/tty`
because the here-document already supplies Python's standard input. Without a terminal, it
stops before deployment.
Do not pass settings as command-line values or handcraft an empty snapshot. Reading the same
`appsettings` resource inside its own ARM write creates a circular dependency.
The template merges only the three ledger values. It does not export secrets, change other
settings, create storage, or modify networks.
Keep configuration writers excluded until readback completes. The Table role uses the same
deterministic name as a new deployment, avoiding duplicate grants on rerun. Its scope is
`.../storageAccounts/<account>/tableServices/default/tables/<table>`, never the storage
account, resource group or subscription. Configuration waits for the role deployment, but
Azure RBAC propagation must still be checked with the API identity before admitting traffic.

After restoring service, save a model grant, replace the allowed set, then revoke all models
for an authorized test person. Verify the affected ledger `M` row contains the latest full UUID
and alias set immediately after each save; deny-all must retain `Configured=true` and
`Models="||"`. Other users and budgets must remain unchanged. Check a direct APIM client:
Invocation Test also reads PostgreSQL, so its success alone does not prove Desktop synchronization.

PostgreSQL commits before immediate projection. A ledger write failure preserves the saved
policy and emits `Model access saved but not projected`; the Telemetry timer retries from
canonical state. Do not report that warning as synchronization success, disable the timer,
or hide it with a frontend delay. A concurrent stale writer or an inaccessible Table still
requires diagnosis; local tests are not proof of Azure propagation or live concurrency.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI with an authenticated subscription context
- `uv` and Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js and npm versions accepted by `frontend/package.json`
- Permission to create the resource group and included resources
- Permission to create role assignments; use Owner, or Contributor plus User Access Administrator, at the target scope

Docker is not required. The observer image is built remotely by Azure Container Registry.

## Prepare public parameters

Copy the example into the ignored `.turnstile` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .turnstile
cp infra/main.parameters.example.json .turnstile/main.parameters.json
```

Set the resource prefix, resource group, Azure and PostgreSQL regions, APIM publisher email, and `bootstrapOwnerEmail`. New deployments provision a capacity-one `StandardV2` APIM by default. `entraClientId` and `entraAllowedEmailDomains` are optional; password Owner login works without Entra.

To run a clean end-to-end deployment without provisioning another APIM service, set all four `existingApimName`, `existingApimResourceGroupName`, `existingApimPrincipalId`, and `existingApimGatewayUrl` values. PostgreSQL and every other platform resource are still created from scratch. The deployment derives environment-unique API, path, product, subscription, logger, diagnostic-setting, and observer Named Value identifiers from `resourcePrefix`, so the shared APIM configuration does not overwrite another Turnstile environment.

Do not add passwords, keys, hashes, or connection strings to this file. The deployment command rejects secure parameter names in the public file.

Interactive deployment prompts for the initial Owner's chosen password. For automation, copy `infra/owner.credentials.example.json` to `.turnstile/owner.credentials.json`, use the same email as `bootstrapOwnerEmail`, choose the password, run `chmod 600`, and pass `--owner-credentials .turnstile/owner.credentials.json`. The plaintext is read only in process memory; state and ARM receive only its scrypt hash.

## Preview

```bash
az login
uv sync --frozen
uv run python -m scripts.deploy plan \
  --subscription <subscription-id> \
  --parameters .turnstile/main.parameters.json
```

The first preview asks for the initial Owner password twice and stores only its scrypt hash. It also creates independent random platform secrets in `.turnstile/deployments/<resource-group>.json` with mode `0600`. Repeated previews and deployments reuse that state.

Before creating deployment state, the command verifies that the selected region supports Flex Consumption, that `Microsoft.App` is registered, and that the selected PostgreSQL region supports PostgreSQL 16 with the configured SKU and availability zone. If either service is unavailable, choose another location and run the preview again.

Review all creates, updates, unsupported previews, role assignments, and network settings. The script refuses every what-if containing a Delete change.

## Deploy

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.deploy deploy \
  --subscription <subscription-id> \
  --parameters .turnstile/main.parameters.json
```

The command runs these phases in order:

1. Re-run the platform what-if and require the exact confirmation `deploy`.
2. Provision the platform with publication and release workers disabled.
3. Build the frontend with the configured public Entra client ID.
4. Install exact Linux x86-64/Python 3.11 dependencies and create deterministic API, telemetry Function, and control-plane Function ZIPs.
5. Deploy the API and Function packages with short-lived Microsoft Entra authentication. Flex Functions use One Deploy, and SCM basic publishing credentials remain disabled.
6. Provision a Basic ACR and observer App Service on its own Premium v3 plan, build the image remotely, and restart the observer. The default is one `P0v3` worker; set `observerPlanSkuName` and `observerPlanWorkerCount` in the deployment parameters when additional compute or horizontal capacity is required.
7. Run another no-delete what-if and enable the workers with the observer URL and APIM Named Value.
8. Verify API health, Function indexing, and real password Owner login.

Generated packages and deployment state remain under `.turnstile/deployments`. The script prints and stores only non-secret Azure outputs.

Fresh installations include the fixed `POST /images/generations` operation with a default
deny policy. Creating the operation does not publish an image model, enable image generation
or authorize a provider call. Model publications inherit the operation into their candidate
revisions and replace only its model-specific policy. The Control-plane publisher does not
need `Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis/operations/write`.

## Initial Owner

The deployment command reads the password interactively and never sends plaintext to ARM. It deploys only the scrypt hash. API startup applies the schema and atomically creates the Owner only when `app_user` is empty; restarts and reruns do not reset the account. Enabled Owner accounts are immediately listed in People under the default AI Platform department so the bootstrap Owner can assign model access before generating gateway traffic. Member department placement still comes from attributed gateway usage.

To rotate a password later, run the existing account command from an authorized application execution context:

```bash
python -m backend.accounts <owner-email> --role owner
```

## Customer Foundry onboarding

The deployment output includes the APIM managed-identity principal ID. Turnstile does not grant it access to customer resources and does not create a Foundry project.

Use the authenticated web console to add the existing Foundry Project Endpoint and model deployment. The user does not enter model capabilities: Turnstile derives them from the provider protocol, including `chat`, `tools`, and `streaming` for OpenAI-family Foundry deployments. If the candidate probe lacks access, the publication pauses and displays the exact principal, resource endpoint, and `Cognitive Services User` role. An Azure user authorized on that Foundry account grants the role, then resumes the publication in the same dialog. Model access remains explicit; assign the new model to the intended people before using Invocation Test.

Creating connections or models through direct API calls does not count as frontend E2E evidence.

### Image and evidence upgrade boundary

Apply pending migrations `004_apim_usage_identity_guard`, `005_billable_request_lifecycle` and `006_versioned_budget_evidence` through the same authorized migration entry point before running the new packages. Do not edit or replay the earlier migrations. The upgrade adds guarded APIM attempt identity, a durable billable-request journal and versioned budget evidence without rewriting historical usage. Drain old consumers before introducing the new identity guard. PostgreSQL concurrency and upgrade safety require the database checks in [Testing](testing.md).

The API and Control-plane packages both require the pinned Pillow dependency for full image validation. The Control-plane artifact includes the public canonical parent policy at `policies/foundry-finops-policy.xml`; publication and image rollback read it through `CONTROL_PLANE_PARENT_POLICY_PATH`. The publisher verifies the live policy and its readback, and refuses incompatible image policies instead of transforming an unknown live template. Use the APIM infrastructure upgrade below before enabling image generation; do not rerun the bootstrap template against customer routing.

Keep `IMAGE_GENERATION_ENABLED=false` and the evidence-v2 cutoff unset during the code and migration rollout. Enabling images, authorizing paid publication probes and scheduling the future evidence cutoff are separate operational decisions. This upgrade does not provision a Foundry account or model, modify an upstream deployment, or grant new provider roles.

### Incremental APIM infrastructure upgrade

Existing installations skip APIM bootstrap when saved deployment outputs exist. Adding a
new operation to the fresh-install template therefore does not upgrade those installations.
The versioned `images-v2` infrastructure upgrade handles the fixed image route and the
image-aware parent contract independently of package deployment and database migrations.

Use the original public parameter file, secret state and matching `.outputs.json` on a
POSIX deployment host (Linux or macOS). Do not generate replacement state or copy another
installation's outputs. The exact APIM, API and maintenance applications are read from
those outputs; a missing API is an error, not permission to initialize it.

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.deploy plan-upgrade \
  --subscription <subscription-id> \
  --parameters .turnstile/main.parameters.json \
  --state .turnstile/deployments/<resource-group>.json
```

The preview snapshots the current revision, API configuration, every operation and every
operation policy. It creates a private plan under `<state-name>.upgrades/images-v2/`, beside
the original state. Plans can contain customer policy values; keep that directory private
and outside Git. The plan binds the exact targets and upgrade template/code hashes.
Preview performs ARM reads and what-if only, without changing platform secrets or resources.

Supported pre-image public parent policies are transformed structurally, preserving their
configured authentication, ledger, telemetry and text values. The transformed policy must
match the current reviewed public contract. An already compatible parent is unchanged.
An existing compatible image operation and its policy are preserved; a missing operation
or missing policy is initialized fail-closed. Unknown/custom parent policies, ambiguous
components and conflicting operation definitions stop automatic migration for explicit
review. No wholesale replacement of a customer's live parent is attempted.

Before applying, schedule a maintenance window and drain pending publications, rollback,
retention and Application provisioning work. Stop the API and Control-plane applications
so no new control-plane work can be submitted or processed. The upgrade verifies both
applications are `Stopped`; draining queued work and excluding other administrators or
deployment systems from this API remain operational prerequisites. Existing direct APIM
text traffic can continue, but the Turnstile web/API application is unavailable while stopped.

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.deploy upgrade \
  --subscription <subscription-id> \
  --parameters .turnstile/main.parameters.json \
  --state .turnstile/deployments/<resource-group>.json
```

The command confirms the saved plan, repeats a no-delete, exact-resource what-if, and uses
the deployment identity, not the Control-plane identity:

1. Clone the original API revision into a deterministic non-current upgrade revision.
2. Add only missing image infrastructure and update the reviewed parent policy in that candidate.
3. Read back the complete candidate; all original operation definitions and policies must remain unchanged.
4. Recheck the current revision and maintenance state, preview the exact release resource,
   and activate the verified candidate.
5. Read back the current revision before recording completion. Keep the original revision
   and all database publication/release history, models, credentials and subscriptions.

The upgrade does not edit shared roles, create resource groups or APIM services, restart
applications, enable images, run inference, set the evidence cutoff, or apply database
migrations. Continue the separately reviewed package/migration rollout and restore service
after the infrastructure upgrade. Ordinary `plan` and `deploy` reruns now reject a pending
APIM infrastructure upgrade before changing secrets or packages.

Retry the same `upgrade` command after a resolved interruption. The private journal and
deterministic revision identify owned work. A complete candidate is not rebuilt; a lost
promotion response is resolved by readback without another promotion. Nonterminal ARM
operations, unrelated revisions, changed live configuration or an unexpected candidate
policy stop recovery. Do not clear the journal or edit a plan to force acceptance.

During the same maintenance window, explicit infrastructure rollback is available:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.deploy rollback-upgrade \
  --subscription <subscription-id> \
  --parameters .turnstile/main.parameters.json \
  --state .turnstile/deployments/<resource-group>.json
```

Rollback requires the recorded promotion and unchanged original/candidate snapshots. It
selects the retained original revision without deleting either revision or changing data.
After subsequent model publications or customer configuration changes, automatic rollback
is refused; review that later state instead of discarding it. Restoring old infrastructure
does not roll back application packages or migrations and is incompatible with enabling
new image functionality. Never clear or reschedule an already effective evidence-v2 cutoff.

## Verify

1. Confirm the infrastructure deployment succeeded.
2. Confirm `/health` returns HTTP 200.
3. Confirm the served frontend asset belongs to the deployed package.
4. Confirm the migration ledger contains each migration listed in [Testing](testing.md) once, with unchanged checksums for previously applied files.
5. Confirm the bootstrapped Owner can sign in with a password.
6. Verify managed-identity role assignments at their intended resource scopes.
7. Complete the real workflow in [E2E Validation](e2e-validation.md).

## Reruns and recovery

The command is idempotent for the same parameter and state files. Keep the state file available: generating replacement platform keys during a rerun can invalidate database credentials, encrypted provider credentials, APIM subscriptions, and observer authentication.

If a phase fails, correct the reported cause and run the same command again. Every infrastructure phase repeats what-if and still refuses Delete changes. Use `--yes` only in controlled automation after separately reviewing `scripts.deploy plan`; it never bypasses the no-delete gate.

## Rollback

Retain the exact previously mounted package and its SHA-256 before each application deployment. A deployment record alone is insufficient; verify the mounted asset and health after rollback.
